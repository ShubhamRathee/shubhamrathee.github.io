    <div class="para"><p>ABC School was established in 1999 by our founder Mr. Amarjit Dhull

        ABC School, part of ABC Educational Society is a co-educational day and day boarding school for students aged 3–18 years. Learning at ABC School is an exciting adventure, full of opportunities for personal development, achievement and enjoyment. From Pre-Prep to Sixth Form we offer an education for life, giving our students the knowledge, skills and values they need to create their own success as thoughtful and confident individuals in the world beyond.
        
        We believe that truly excellent education is about more than academic achievement alone: it is also about developing a passion for learning, capacity for independent thinking, moral values, self-confidence without arrogance, and genuine interests that extend beyond the confines of the classroom. We believe that the virtues of tolerance, understanding, respect and courtesy really matter. We strive to ensure that our students have an understanding of their place in society – locally, nationally and globally – and seek to make a positive impact upon it.
        
        Our aim is to ensure every student’s aspirations, capabilities, interests and talents are recognized, nurtured and celebrated. We pride ourselves on our academic standards, extra-curricular provision and pastoral care. The students value their dedicated and experienced teachers and the whole school community is justifiably proud of its excellent academic achievements and examination results.</p></div>
